Why?

PH-based MVP → cost matters

Court finder → custom layers are useful

Community growth → pricing won’t explode

React + React Native → Mapbox fits perfectly

Stripe vs Xendit
✅Global 		✅South Asian payment platform design for PH
🔥Xendit generally has clear, competitive local pricing with no hidden monthly costs — often cheaper for local wallets and bank payments. Stripe’s pricing is robust but may be slightly higher and more complex depending on country setup.

| Feature                | **Stripe**     							|	**Xendit**      |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------  
| Local e-wallets        | *Via custom setup*                     | ✅ (GCash, ShopeePay, Maya, GrabPay) ([Xendit Help Center][1]) |
| Cards                  | ✅ Worldwide support ([Stripe][2])      | ✅ Local & international cards ([Xendit Help Center][1])       |
| Subscriptions          | ✅ Built-in billing tools ([Stripe][3]) | ✅ Recurring billing support ([Xendit Help Center][1])         |
| Payment Links          | ✅                                      | ✅ Free to create ([Xendit][4])                                |
| Invoicing              | ✅                                      | ✅ Integrated invoicing capability ([Xendit][5])               |
| Marketplace payouts    | Stripe Connect                         | Xendit Platform Fee system possible ([Xendit][6])             |
| Multi-currency support | ✅ Strong global support ([Stripe][2])  | Limited local focus (but can expand regionally) ([Xendit][4]) |

Use Stripe if:

✅ You plan for international users or revenue outside the Philippines
✅ You need advanced subscription, marketplace, or complex billing flows
✅ You want a large global developer ecosystem and extensive built-in tools

Use Xendit if:

✅ Your early users will be Philippines-based
✅ You want broad local payment support (GCash, Maya, bank transfers)
✅ You want simple pricing with no monthly fees
✅ You want local settlement and reconciliation tools


| Aspect                      | **Stripe**      `						  | **Xendit**      |

| Best for                    | Global scale, advanced billing features     | Philippines local payment options       
| Pricing                     | Transparent but potentially higher globally | Typically lower local fees, pay-per-use 
| Developer Ecosystem         | Large, mature APIs                          | Growing, region-focused APIs            
| Local Payments              | Limited without custom add-ons              | Extensive local support                
| Marketplace & Subscriptions | Strong built-in tools                       | Good support with optional features

Twilio vs Semaphore 
| Feature                       | **Twilio**               | **Semaphore**         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| SMS API                       | ✅ Enterprise-grade       | ✅ Simple & local      |
| Bulk SMS                      | ✅                        | ✅                     |

| Sender ID customization       | Supported (varies)       | Sender Name supported |
| Delivery reports              | Detailed & programmatic  | Basic logging         |
| Global SMS reach              | ✅                        | Primarily PH          |
| Pricing model                 | Usage + optional monthly | Pay-per-SMS credits   |
| Ease of setup                 | Medium                   | Easy                  |
| Multi-channel (WhatsApp etc.) | Yes                      | Focused on SMS        |


🔥Twilio is more feature rich and global, but can be costlier especially for high OTP volume.

🔥Semaphore is much more cost-predictable for Philippines locales, easy to integrate, and often cheaper for transactional/OTP SMS.

FILE/IMAGE UPLOADS

Uploadthing vs Supabase Storage - Built-in with Supabase (FREE on Pro plan)
| Feature         				| **Supabase Storage (built-in)**  													|  **UploadThing**  | 
| **Integration with Supabase stack** | 🌟 Natively integrated (Auth + RBAC, RLS) ([Supabase][1])					| ❌ Separate — needs custom integration          |
| **Global CDN**                      | ✅ Built-in (285+ cities) ([Supabase][1])                                       | ⚠️ Depends on storage backend                                        |
| **Auth & Access control**           | 🎯 Fine-grained RLS + bucket policies ([Supabase][1])                          | Managed by you in server routes                                      |
| **Resumable uploads / large files** | ✅ TUS protocol, resumable up to >50GB ([Supabase][2])                          | Depends on backend and service plan                                  |
| **Image optimization**              | ⚡ On-the-fly image transforms ([Supabase][3])                                  | ❌ None built-in                                                      |
| **Client integrations**             | Standard Supabase SDK (`supabase.storage`)                                     | ✅ UploadButton & hooks for Next.js/React ([v6.uploadthing.com][4])   |
| **Dashboard for uploads**           | Basic file browser in Supabase UI                                              | 📊 Dedicated upload dashboard (with tracking) ([uploadthing][5])     |
| **Preset UI components**            | ❌ Not provided — you build UI                                                  | ✅ Prebuilt upload components                                         |
| **Pricing model**                   | Included with *Supabase Pro* Storage allocation (effectively free up to quota) | 📦 Tiered storage plans (2 GB free, then $10+/mo) ([uploadthing][5]) |
| **Storage quotas**                  | Based on Supabase plan (Pro includes storage allowance)                        | Defined by UploadThing plan                                          |
| **Custom upload logic**             | You implement via SDK/Edge functions                                           | Built-in route handlers & callbacks                                  |
| **Best use case**                   | General file storage tied closely to app backend                               | **Quick uploads** with UI components & minimal boilerplate           |

🤔 When to Choose Which (for PicklePlay)
📍 Use Supabase Storage if:

- You want all backend services under Supabase (auth, DB, storage) for easier management.

- You don’t mind building custom upload UI and logic.

- You want tight access control via RLS and built-in CDN.

📍 Use UploadThing if:

- You want fast development with built-in UI upload components.

- You want to offload upload logic/callbacks and don’t mind paying for storage.

- You need standardized upload flows across frameworks (e.g., React, Expo).

🔥Since you’re already on Supabase Pro with storage included, Supabase Storage is generally the best choice for long-term cost, integration, and security — and you can always layer UploadThing components later if you want easier upload UIs
